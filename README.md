# PA_AMB_TOMAQUET
*PA AMB TOMÀQUET is a work in progress c++ 2D game engine*

### Try demo:
*You need SDL2 in order to build the demo*
1. With your bash go to DEMO folder
2. Do makefile in order to build PA_AMB_TOMAQUET_DEMO.out
  - If it's the first/second time you run it and it doesn't work properly, please rerun it

### Instruments that I have used for this project:
- g++
- SDL2
- gdb
- VIM
- git
- GraphicsGale
- GNU makefile
- Catch2

### What's next?
1. Run tests by makefile
2. Implement more Catch2 tests
3. Implement Double Buffer
4. Implement Entity Component System
