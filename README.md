# PA_AMB_TOMAQUET
*After been inspired by a talk about game engines at AprenDev Barcelona 2019, I have decided, a year later, to develop one myself, It's name is PA_AMB_TOMAQUET.*

### Try demo:
*You need SDL2 in order to build the demo*
1. With your bash go to DEMO folder
2. Do makefile in order to build PA_AMB_TOMAQUET_DEMO.out
  - If it's the first/second time you run it and it doesn't work properly, please rerun it

### Instruments that I have used for this project:
- g++
- SDL2
- gdb
- VIM
- git
- GraphicsGale
